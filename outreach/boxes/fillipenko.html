										<h2>Colpit Occilators</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In order to create a signal, we decided to take inspiration from the traditional LRC circuit and make use of a colpitt occilator. We created two seperate colpit occilators such that they had the same resonance frequency, but different inductance. The inductor that detected the metal should be a 
										wide circular detector made with wound copper wire. For the non-detection inductor, a torriod was used to create a small inductor with minimal wire, and was tuned match the resonacne frequency of the first colbit occilator.
										
										<p>Passing the detector over a non-metal will do nothing, but when a metal is introduced into detector, the magnetic flux of iductor changes, and thus the frequency at which it resonates also changes.</p>
									</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h2>Mixer Circuits</h2>
									</header>
									<p>	In the presenece of a metal, the colbit occilators are no longer matched. These signals can then be fed into whats known as a mixer circuit, which traditionally outputs the addition, subtracion, and the product between the two input frequencies.
										For the metal detector, the difference in frequency is of most interest. The mixer circuit presented filters out the other signals and only perserves the subtraction of the frequencies. This new frequency is then ammplied using an op-amp and finally passed through a speaker.
										Ideally, the two colpitt ocilliators would resonate at the exact same frequenct, and no signal would be amplied through the speaker until a metal is present. Since there will always exist a small difference in resonant frequency, this signal is always passed through and a constant
										pitch is heard and changed in the presence of a metal. And thus, a metal detector is created using a few circuit components!
